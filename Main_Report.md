## 3. Agent Skills

### 3.1. Agent Skills Overall

| Component | Type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Test Generator** | Coordinator | Coordinates the complete API test-generation process and combines results |
| **Domain Test Generator** | Specialized generator | Performs equivalence partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis |
| **State Transition Test Generator** | Specialized generator | Models states and valid/invalid transitions when applicable |
| **Security Test Generator** | Specialized generator | Derives security tests from applicable SEC-01–SEC-07 requirements |
| **Contract Test Generator** | Specialized generator | Validates request and response contracts/schema |
| **AI Audit** | Reused supporting skill | Records AI interactions and file modifications into the AI Audit Report |

The first five components form the **AI-driven API Test Generator architecture** designed for HW06.

The **AI Audit** skill (reused from homework `HW05-AI`) operates alongside this architecture. It records the AI-assisted workflow so that the generation, review, correction, and implementation activities remain auditable.

### 3.2. Skills Design

The design artifacts for the **API Test Generator** and its four specialized generators are stored in the `skills-design/` folder. Each generator has its own subfolder containing its design specification and corresponding diagram.

The **AI Audit** skill is not included in this folder because it is a reusable skill carried over from HW05.
