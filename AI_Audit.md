## AI Interaction Log

### Artifact 1

- **User:** Vương Ngũ Tín Thành
- **Date and Time:** 2026-08-19 23:39:52 GMT+7
- **Model Used:** GPT-5.6 Sol
- **Skill Used:**
  - `skill-creator`
  - `ai-audit`
- **Prompt:**

````markdown
Use [$skill-creator](C:\\Users\\xing0\\.codex\\skills\\.system\\skill-creator\\SKILL.md) and [$ai-audit](D:\\GitHub\\SoftwareTesting-HW06\\.agents\\skills\\ai-audit\\SKILL.md)

Create postman-test-generator agent skills. I've already designed the skill in [postman-test-generator.md](D:/GitHub/SoftwareTesting-HW06/skills-design/postman-test-generator/postman-test-generator.md).
````

- **AI Output:**

````markdown
The design is narrow enough that the skill should **convert reviewed CSV cases, not invent tests**. I’m also keeping Newman compatibility as a hard output constraint and treating the conversion report as a traceability/validation artifact because your input contract includes `conversion_report_path`.

The skill draft is now aligned to your design: CSV is authoritative for test intent, the API spec only resolves implementation details, and the skill explicitly avoids adding a review/design phase. I’m validating the package now, then I’ll build the audit file from the completed interactions available to ai-audit.

Done

`postman-test-generator` passed `skill-creator`'s `quick_validate.py`. Its main boundaries are: reviewed CSV test cases are authoritative, it does not design new cases, it generates Postman Collection v2.1 + conversion report, preserves traceability, requires `X-Student-Id`, parameterizes runtime values, and targets Newman-compatible scripts.

    - `Deleted:` None.
    - `Replaced With:` None.
    - `Appended:` Added the OpenAI agent configuration for the `postman-test-generator` skill.
- **Verdict:** INCOMPLETE
- **Reasoning:**
  - Preconditions notes may be lost. The skill does not explicitly preserve them.
  - Collection validation is too weak. It only checks valid JSON and v2.1 declaration, not full Postman v2.1 schema validity.
- **Student Fixes:** Continue state these defects out and guide the agent to fix them.

### Artifact 2

- **User:** Vương Ngũ Tín Thành
- **Date and Time:** 2026-08-20 00:22:32 GMT+7
- **Model Used:** GPT-5.6 Sol
- **Skill Used:**
  - `skill-creator`
  - `ai-audit`
- **Prompt:**

````markdown
There are some defects in the implemented `postman-test-generator` skill.

- Preconditions notes may be lost. The skill does not explicitly preserve them. 
- Collection validation is too weak. It only checks valid JSON and v2.1 declaration, not full Postman v2.1 schema validity. 

Use [$skill-creator](C:\\Users\\xing0\\.codex\\skills\\.system\\skill-creator\\SKILL.md) to revise the skill.
````

- **AI Output:**

````markdown
I’ll revise the existing skill in place, specifically addressing both defects: preserve precondition notes explicitly through conversion/traceability, and validate the generated collection against the full Postman Collection v2.1 schema rather than only checking JSON/version metadata. Then I’ll rerun `$skill-creator` validation and package the revised skill.

The prior generated working directory is no longer present in the sandbox, but the original design package is still available. I’m reconstructing the skill from that authoritative design plus the same `$skill-creator` rules, carrying forward the prior decisions (reviewed CSV as authority, Newman compatibility, traceability, and no test-case invention) while patching only the two identified defects.

One important interaction between the two fixes: preconditions should **not** be preserved by adding arbitrary custom JSON fields, because that can itself break v2.1 schema validity. I’m preserving them in schema-supported request descriptions and in the conversion report, with exact source text retained for traceability.

Both corrections are now implemented in the skill instructions. I also added a deterministic schema-validation helper so future executions can’t accidentally “pass” a collection merely because it is JSON with a v2.1 declaration.

Revised with `$skill-creator`.

The two defects are fixed:

- **Preconditions are explicitly preserved**
  - Kept in a schema-supported request description under `Preconditions` / `Setup`.
  - Also copied to the conversion report for traceability.
  - If a precondition cannot be automated safely, it stays as a note and is flagged instead of being dropped.
  - Arbitrary custom Postman fields are prohibited because they can violate the collection schema.

- **Full Postman v2.1 schema validation**
  - Added `references/validation.md`.
  - Added `scripts/validate_postman_collection.py`.
  - Validation now requires the complete Postman Collection v2.1 JSON Schema; valid JSON plus `info.schema` is explicitly insufficient.
  - Schema errors include their JSON paths and cause a non-zero exit.
  - The collection is only finalized after full schema validation passes.
  - The skill uses Postman’s documented v2.1 schema location. ([github.com](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-api-sdk-ts/blob/main/documentation/models/ModifyCollectionSchemaInfo.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

I also tested the validator with both a passing collection and a deliberately schema-invalid collection; the invalid one was correctly rejected. `$skill-creator`'s `quick_validate.py` also reports **`Skill is valid!`**.
